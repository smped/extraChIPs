Description: This package builds on existing tools and adds some simple but
   extremely useful capabilities for working wth ChIP-Seq data. The focus is 
   on detecting differential binding windows/regions. 
   One set of functions focusses on set-operations retaining mcols for GRanges
   objects, whilst another group of functions are to aid visualisation of 
   results.
   Coercion to tibble objects is also included.
