#' @description Make a set of consensus peaks based on umber of replicates
#'
#' @details
#' This takes a list of GRanges objects and forms a set of consensus peaks.
#'
#' When using method = "union" the union ranges of all overlapping peaks will
#' be returned, using the minimum proportion of replicates specified.
#' When using method = "coverage", only the regions within each overlapping
#' range which are 'covered' by the minimum proportion of replicates specified
#' are returned. This will return narrower peaks in general, although some
#' artefactual very small ranges may be included (e.g. 10bp). Careful setting
#' of the min_width parameter may be very helpful for these instances. It is
#' also expected that setting method = "coverage" should return the region
#' within each range which is more likely to contain the true binding site for
#' the relevant ChIP targets
#'
#'
#' @param x A GRangesList
#' @param p The minimum proportion of samples (i.e. elements of `x`) required
#' for a peak to be retained in the output. By default all merged peaks will
#' be returned
#' @param var Additional columns in the `mcols` element to retain
#' @param method Either return the union of all overlapping ranges, or the
#' regions within the overlapping ranges which are covered by the specified
#' proportion of replicates. When using p = 0, both methods will return identical
#' results
#' @param ignore.strand,simplify,... Passed to \link{reduceMC} or
#' \link{intersectMC} internally
#' @param min_width Discard any regions below this width
#'
#' @return
#' `GRanges` object with mcols containing a logical vector for every element of
#' x, along with the column `n` which adds all logical columns. These columns
#' denote which replicates contain an overlapping peak for each range
#'
#' If any additional columns have been requested using `var`, these will be
#' returned as CompressedList objects as produced by `reduceMC()` or
#' `intersectMC()`.
