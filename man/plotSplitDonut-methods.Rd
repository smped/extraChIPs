\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{GRanges} or \code{data.frame}-like object}

\item{...}{Not used}

\item{scale_by}{Column to scale values by. If provided, values in this column
will be summed, instead of simply counting entries. Any label in the centre
of the plot will also reflect this difference}

\item{inner}{Column name to create the inner ring}

\item{outer}{Column name to create the outer ring, subset by the inner ring}

\item{scale_factor}{When scaling by another column, such as width, totals
will be divided by this value, with 1000 being the default to provide output
in kb.}

\item{r_centre}{The radius of the hole in the centre. Setting to zero will
create a Pie chart}

\item{r_inner, r_outer}{The radii of the inner/outer rings}

\item{total_glue}{\link[glue]{glue}-syntax for formatting the total which
appears in the centre of the plot. Internally, the value \code{N} will be
calculated and as such, this value should appear within this argument.}

\item{total_size}{Label size total number of entries in the centre of the
plot.}

\item{total_colour}{Label colour for the summary total in the centre}

\item{inner_glue, outer_glue}{\link[glue]{glue}-syntax for formatting labels
which appear on each inner/outer segment Internally, the values \code{n} and \code{p}
will be calculated as totals and proportions of the total. As such, these
values can appear within this argument, as well as the fields described in
the details}

\item{total_label, inner_label, outer_label}{Can take values 'text', 'label'
or 'none'. If setting one the first two values, the labelling function
\verb{geom_*} will be called, otherwise no label will be drawn}

\item{label_alpha, inner_label_alpha, outer_label_alpha}{transparency for
labels}

\item{label_size, inner_label_size, outer_label_size}{Size of all text labels}

\item{label_colour, inner_label_colour, outer_label_colour}{Takes any colour
specification, with the additional option of 'palette'. In this special case,
the same palette as is used for each segment will be applied.}

\item{min_p, inner_min_p, outer_min_p}{only display labels for segments
representing greater than this proportion of the total. If inner/outer values
are specified, the values in \code{min_p} will be ignored for that layer}

\item{max_p, inner_max_p, outer_max_p}{only display labels for segments
representing less than this proportion of the total. If inner/outer values
are specified, the values in \code{max_p} will be ignored for that layer}

\item{inner_pattern, outer_pattern}{Regular expressions which are combined
with max_p and min_p values for accurately choosing labels}

\item{inner_rotate, outer_rotate}{logical(1). Rotate labels for inner or outer
rings. This will be ignored by when setting the geom as "label".
See \link[ggplot2]{geom_text}}

\item{explode_inner, explode_outer}{Regular expressions from either the inner
or outer ring for which segments will be 'exploded'}

\item{explode_query}{Setting to AND and specifying values for both the inner
and outer ring will require matches in both categories}

\item{explode_x, explode_y}{Numeric values for shifting exploded values}

\item{explode_r}{Radius expansion for exploded values}

\item{nudge_r, inner_nudge_r, outer_nudge_r}{Radius expansion for labels}

\item{expand}{Passed to \link[ggplot2]{expansion} for both x and y axes}

\item{inner_palette}{Colour palette for the inner ring}

\item{outer_palette}{Optional colour palette for the outer ring}

\item{inner_legend, outer_legend}{logical(1). Show legends for either layer}

\item{layout}{Passed to \link[patchwork]{plot_layout}}
}
\value{
A patchwork object consisting of both ggplot2 objects and legend grobs

\description{
Create Donut charts based on one or two columns in a data frame
}
\details{
Using a data.frame or GRanges object, this function enables creation of a
Pie/Donut chart with an inner and outer ring. The function itself is
extremely flexible allowing for separate colour palettes in the inner and
outer rings, as well as highly customisable labels.

Sections can be exploded using a value from the inner ring or outer ring
separately, or in combination by setting \code{explode_query = "AND"}.
Exploded sections can be shifted by expanding the radius (\code{explode_r}), or
along the x/y co-ordinates using \code{explode_x/y}, allowing for detailed
placement of sections.

If only the inner palette is specified, segments in the outer ring will be
assigned the same colours as the inner segments, but with increased
transparency. Only a single legend will be drawn in this scenario. If an
outer palette is specified, both colour palettes are completely distinct
and two distinct legends will be drawn. The placement of these legends,
along with the larger donut plot, can be manually specified by providing a
layout as defined in \link[patchwork]{plot_layout}. Names are not required
on this layout, but may be beneficial for code reproducibility.

The inner label denoting the total can also be heavily customised using the
\link[glue]{glue} syntax to present the calculated value \code{N} along with any
additional text, such as 'kb' if scaling GenomicRanges by width. The same
approach can be taken for the inner and outer labels, where totals are
held in the value \code{n}, proportions are held in the value \code{p} and the values
corresponding to each segment can be accessed using \code{.data[[inner]]} or
\code{.data[[outer]]}. Column titles can be added using \code{{inner}}/\code{{outer}}.
Values from the inner segments can be added to the outer
labels using this strategy enabling a wide variety of labelling approaches
to be utilised.
