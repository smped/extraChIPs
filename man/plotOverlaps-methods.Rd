\arguments{
\item{x}{GRangesList of S3 list able to be coerced to character vectors}

(UpSet plot only)}

numeric vector}

\item{.sort_sets}{passed to \code{sort_sets} in \link[ComplexUpset]{upset}}

\item{hj_sets}{Horizontal adjustment of set size labels}

\value{
Either a VennDiagram (i.e. grid) object, or a ComplexUpset plot
}
\description{
Plot Overlaps between list elements as an upset or Venn diagram
}
\details{
This function should give the capability to show overlaps for any number of
replicates or groups, or a list of items such as gene names.
For n = 2, a scaled Venn Diagram will be produced, however no scaling is
implemented for n = 3

UpSet plots are possible for any lists with length > 1, and are the only
implemented possibility for lists > 3.

If the input is a \code{GRangesList} an additional boxplot can be requested
using any numeric column within the existing \code{mcols()} element.
Values will be summarised across all elements using the requested function
and the boxplot will be included as an upper panel above the intersections
}
\examples{
## Examples using a list of character vectors
ex <- list(
  x = letters[1:5], y = letters[c(6:15, 26)], z = letters[c(2, 10:25)]
)
plotOverlaps(ex, type = "upset")
plotOverlaps(ex, type = "venn", set_col = 1:3, alpha = 0.3)
plotOverlaps(ex, type = "upset", set_col = 1:3, labeller = stringr::str_to_title)
plotOverlaps(ex[1:2])

## GRangesList object will produce a boxplot of summarised values in the
## upper panel
data("peaks")
grl <- peaks[1:3]
names(grl) <- gsub("_peaks.+", "", names(grl))
plotOverlaps(grl, type = 'upset', var = 'score', f = 'max')

## If only two samples are present, a VennDiagram will be produced
plotOverlaps(grl[1:2], set_col = c("green", "blue"))
